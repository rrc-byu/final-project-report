# RRC-BYU Capstone Project Final Report

As the culmination of your project, we expect a report that summarizes your results.
The goal of this report is twofold:
  1. Demonstrate your results to Rincon and recommend the best way to use less labels in an object detection setting;
  2. Show off your data science skills -- you should be proud to show this to your parents or an employer.

## Due Date
The report is due by April 18, 2023.

## Submission
The report should be pushed to the [final project report repo](https://github.com/rrc-byu/final-project-report) in the `rrc-byu` group.
The report should be formatted as a .pdf.
If you would prefer another format, just ask your project liasion (Taylor Paskett, tjpa@rincon.com).

## Requirements
The report should consist of at least the following sections:
  - Abstract
  - Methods
  - Results
  - Recommendations
  
### Abstract
In about one paragraph, this section should outline the overall project and summarize your results.

### Methods
Here, your methodology and the process you used in your experiments should be described. 
You should describe the model(s) you worked with, what the data you used was like, and how you did training and evaluation.
As much as you can, explain / justify *why* you made certain decisions in your experiments.

If you did something that didn't work out or was unsuccessful, don't leave it out! 
Knowing that something is difficult to pursue is very helpful, and RRC wants to hear about it.

We would also like to hear about your experience with the various tech stacks available to you, and which tools helped you succeed.

### Results
In this section, you should describe the results of your experiments. 
The results section should contain images and graphs that help convey your results in a clear and compelling way.

### Recommendations
This section should contain your final recommendations to RRC based on your experiments.

## Other
- You should cite any sources that need to be cited; how these are formatted is up to you.
- Feel free to include images from the original papers you implemented (if they help communicate your methods).
- Assume that your audience is a smart person who knows a little about machine learning. It should have enough technical depth to be interesting to an ML practitioner or data scientist, but simple enough that a non-expert could understand it (perhaps after some Googling).
